## Start Your GH Workflow

Remember, before you start anything else, always follow this GH methodological workflow:

1. Create meaningful **branch** that uses the agreed upon naming scheme: `CHP/x--name_of_chp`.
2. Practice the iterative process to **commit** and **push** regularly with meaningful **commit messages**.

## Overview

The latest JS standard defines eight data types that are called **primitives**, i.e., the most basic units of data in the JS language:

1. [**String**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/String). A sequence of characters that represent a text value scoped by double quotes `""`. For example:
    ```javascript
    let hello = "Howdy!"
    ```
2. [**Number**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Number). An integer or floating point number. For example:
    ```javascript
    let life = 42
    const pi = 3.14159
    ```
3. [**Boolean**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean): `true` and `false`.
    ```javascript
    let booleanTrue = true
    let booleanFalse = false
    ```
4. [**null**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Null). A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, `null` is not the same as `Null`, `NULL`, or any other variant.)
5. [**undefined**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Undefined). Assigned automatically to variables that have just been declared: `undefined`.
    ```javascript
    let x
    console.log(x) //Output: undefined
    ```
6. [**Object**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Object). Objects are a collection of properties, which are structured and identified using key-value pairs. They can be parsed/looped-thru, retrieved, and accessed with two main types of syntax, as seen below:
    ```javascript
    let diffGreetings = {
      simple: "Hello.",
      dull: "Hey.",
    }

    // Assign new property to object
    diffGreetings.excited = "Wasssssup!"

    // Both Output: "Wasssssup!"
    console.log(diffGreetings['excited'])
    console.log(diffGreetings.excited)
    ```
7. [**Symbol**](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol). Don't worry about this one. It's rarely used. It is a data type whose instances are unique and immutable.
8. [**BigInt**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/BigInt). Don't worry about this one either. It's rarely used. It is an integer with arbitrary precision. For example: `9007199254740992n`.

Primitives enable you to perform fundamental data operations.

## E1. Create a Suite of Primitives

1. Convert the `javascript` codeblock to an executable block with the `js`.
2. Declare and initialize your own suite of primitives (1-6) from an above: String, Number, Boolean, null, undefined, and Object.
    - **NOTE**: Have fun with it! Choose a theme like your favorite movie, story, hobby, etc.
3. Print them all to the console with `console.log()`.
4. Check your work, as you go, by opening the browser console with the **Inspect Element** tool.

```javascript
// Write your code in here
```

## Submission

1. Create a **PR** (**pull request**) and use the provided content in the template to start it.
2. Respond to your peers and comment on their work too.
3. Submit the PR link in Moodle, when you're ready.
