# 2.2-The Humanity of Data: Recognizing the Rhetorics of Data, Queer Data, and Data Feminism

<p style="display:none"></p>

## Start Your GH Workflow

Remember, before you start anything else, always follow this GH methodological workflow:

1. Create meaningful **branch** that uses the agreed upon naming scheme: `CHP/X.x--lastname`.
2. Practice the iterative process to **commit** and **push** regularly with meaningful **commit messages**.

## Overview

In chapter 2.1, we started thinking about translating more quantitive practices into typically humanities-oriented professional practices. In this chapter, we remember the value of humanist values and critical thinking, and I ask that we consider how the two are not mutually exclusive, but are, instead, complimentary and integral for a socially just ethic.

With these goals for the texts in mind, please respond to the questions herein about the assigned readings.

- Guyan, Kevin. (2022). <em>Queer Data: Using Gender, Sex, and Sexuality Data for Action</em>. Read the ***Introduction***, pp. 7-22.
    - You can forgo the chapter outlines in the introduction.
    - Chapter 2 is available in this PDF, but is optional for you to skim and read on your own. I definitely recommend this book.
- Lee, Jayne Chong-Soon. (1992/1995). Navigating the topology of race. In K. Crenshaw, N. Gotanda, G. Peller, and K. Thomas, (Eds.), *Critical Race Theory (pp. 441-449)*.
    - This article is actually an excerpt from Lee's longer review essay published earlier in the *Stanford Law Review* (1992).
- Lindgren, Chris. (2024). A Stasis Network methodology to reckon with the rhetorical process of data: How a data team qualified meaning and practices</a>. <em>Technical Communication Quarterly, 33.</em>4, 475-500, https://doi.org/10.1080/10572252.2024.2306259. Focus on the following 4 parts:
    1. "Introduction" & "Defining stasis" (pp. 475-477)
    2. Understand how Table 2 (p. 480-481) was used to code the fieldwork data.
    3. "Background and context" and "Data collection" (pp. 481-482), so you can understand the case-study.
    4. Read through the "Findings" and "Discussion" (pp. 484-492).

## 1. Question about "Seven intersectional feminist principles ..."

### 1.1 Data and power

**Question**: According to D'Ignazio and Klein, what principles concern data and "power"? Define and discuss each principle below. Be sure to note the important questions to ask about data and power.

1. **Examine Power**: understanding how power is structured in society

     * Data science for whom?
     * Data science by whom?
     * Data science with whose interests and goals in mind?

2. **challenge power**: commit to rebalancing the unequal distribution of power
   
3. **elevate emotion an embodiment**: value emotion as a part of data science
4. **rethink binaries and hierachies**: challenge the gender binary and strive for equality of all genders. There is the hidden hierarchy (patriarchy) within the gender binary
5. **embrace pluralism**: collect data from multiple perspecitves and communities
6. **consider context**: consider what context data was collect and analyzed in. Any context will produce bias and impact the data.
7. **make labor visible**: value, recognize, and compensate labor

### 1.2 Data: Objective mirror, or not?

**Question**: What do D'Ignazio and Klein mean by issues of "false binaries and hidden hierarchies" (p. 3)? Then, explain how principles 3, 5, 6 and 7 each approach such issues.

The authors argue that most binaries will have a hidden hierarchy. Of the options in a binary, one might have more power than the other. For example, on the gender binary, men have more power since we live in a patriarchy, thus being a "hidden hierarchy". principle 3 deals with this by pointing out how emotion (women being seen as more emotional) in research is useful, but often looked down upon because it doesn't stick to "just the facts". Principle 5 discusses who gets to share knowledge and encouraging Indigenous groups to share their knowledge. Historically indigenous knowledge has been excluded from research for not following the scientific method. Principle 6 focuses on the context of data. A quote that stood out is "Race isn't a risk factor...racism is". Researchers must understand the power structure of race, class, gender, etc. to see how it impacts data analysis. finally, principle 7 encourages recognition of labor as marginalized groups have not hard their work attributed to themselves in the past(and currently).

## 2. Questions about Queer Data

### 2.1 Defining "queer data" & "intersectional LGBTQ data"

**Question**: Create a bulleted list of short excerpts and summary statements where Guyan defines "queer data" and "intersectional LGBTQ data" in the introduction. Be sure to accompany all excerpts and paraphrases with page number locations in the PDF.

- Queer data goes beyond exploring non-cishet individuals (p.12)
- "challenge to conventional understandings of how data and identities intersect" (p. 12)
- "queer data disrupts the binaries of male/female, heterosexual/homosexual and cis/trans" (p. 12)
- The data is telling the story of a person/community (p. 12)
- We cannot separate the experiences of gender and sexuality from other identities (p.22)
- new challenges emerge with the inter section of multiple identities (p.29)
- "intersectional LGBTQ data tells a nuanced story that better reflects the messy and overlapping experiences of people everyday lives" (p. 29)

**Question**: Based on your list above, write your own movie tagline, i.e., a short and entertaining one-liner that tries to capture one of the main aspects of "queer data", and another tagline about "intersectional LGBTQ data."

*Queer Data*: Beyond a checkbox: the story of queer data
 
*intersectional LGBTQ data*: Our stories intertwine

### 2.2 Guyan's exigence for the book

**Question**: Why did Guyan write this book? What was his exigence?

Having worked with large universities/organziations Guyan saw how even with the increased research on the queer community, the lives of queer people have not improved (as seen by the number of hate crimes). Guyan want data to focus more on the stories of people and provide meaningful change. Used correctly, queer data can boost activism and  "enable LGBTQ people to lead full, authentic lives." (p. 33)

### 2.3 "Prescriptive" versus "descriptive"

**Question**: What does Guyan mean when he labels terms like gender, sex, and sexuality as being descriptive—*not* prescriptive (see pp. 13-14 in particular)? Explain the differences between the two with an example from each of the terms.

### 2.4 "'Visibility is a trap'"

**Question**: Guyan cites Foucault's idea about how "'visibility is a trap'" (p. 20 of the PDF). What does this expression mean, and why does Guyan draw parallels between Foucault's original use of it with issues of power and data? Be sure to illuminate your discussion with specific examples that Guyan uses in the book.

## 3. Questions about "The topology of race"

**Context**: In this reading, you read a shorter excerpt from a longer review essay by Lee. In this review essay, Lee summarizes Kwame Anthony Appiah's collection of essays, *In My Father's House*, as a means of instigating new lines of inquiry for legal studies.

### 3.1 Race & racism: From conjecture to questions of definition

**Question**: Why does Lee think it important that Appiah changed the standard line of inquiry in legal studies from "whether racism exists" (p. 441) to "what race and racism are"? What "overdetermined" (p. 441) parts or race, i.e., issues about race, does this definitional question bring into focus for deliberation? Be sure to ***define*** and discuss Appiah's position about race as being essential/biological or not and being cultural or not. Indeed, pay close attention to Appiah's definition of culture.

### 3.2 Race as multiplicitous

**Question**: What does Lee mean by "race is always multiplicitous because social contexts are multiplicitous" (p. 447)? Use the Shaw v. Reno case to help you explain how this challenges both essentialist/biological definitions of race & Appiah's race as synonomous with culture.

### 4.3 What's the "DMT cluster"?

**Question**: What's the *DMT cluster*, and how did connect to observations about the data team's judgment about the *quality of metrics*?

## 5. Synthesis Response

**Question**: Pick and choose any particular combination of concepts and heuristics from the readings in 2.1 and 2.3. Use these questions and ideas to discuss your understanding of the 2024 NC General Election mail-in ballot data. What questions and criticisms do you have about the dataset's categories, hieararchies, collection, etc.?
